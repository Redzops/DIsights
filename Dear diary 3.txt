       Today was nice, warmer that usually so, it was nice to not have the freezing cold for once. I had lots of fun with my cousins we went out and had a lunch outside. Obviously, we enjoyed the weather and that really improved my mood to a positive direction. I don't know why I really don't have anything to write about tonight but, I had fun today, it was much better than the previous days. At night I went out to a party on a rooftop which was epic because of the view from the 12 floor and off course the clear skies help a lot. I am very sleepy so ill keep it short for tonight. 
       As for the Ship, I did not work on it at all.  I still need to hire a loyal crew. Nothing new at all. I will be visiting an old battlefield tomorrow called Harrison Island.
