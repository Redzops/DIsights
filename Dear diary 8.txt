       Never in my life did I think this will be a thought journey, cant relate to my roommates at all. I have a midterm coming up this Friday. My Fitness is horrible I'm not eating as much at all, for the past two days, all I ate was two meals. My first one was all by my self that was very boring the other dinner was much better I ate with Keagan "Keegs". At the gym today I did horribly, I worked my biceps and triceps and ran a quarter and a half mile in 20 mins which is very bad. 
     On the bright side, I'm going back to my regular prayers, and I need them in my life. I plan to go back to the gym like every other day. I must get my self checked out at the doctor ASAP, my burping is bothering me and one-day im constipated and the other I have a weird bowel movement. I need to get my self together. I'm amazed at how I kept my sanity all together, and iv heard that other people went back to there home because they haven't been coping with homesickness.
    I haven't talked about my ship in a long time so in the short term its still sitting on the cold landing pad. I haven't got back to check it at all since my arrival here. By springtime, it will rust for sure.

	As always im looking forward for tomorrow, im exited and ready to meet my adventure.
