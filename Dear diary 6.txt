       Its Thursday night, Im very anxious, I don't know even why, Im so glad I did all my prayers I still have one more left for tonight. I don't know why I miss my past all of a sudden I can remember every thought of my past. I know I need to learn from it and stop staring at it but, all of sudden I just want to embrace it, I don't know why. Im not depressed but im always questioning my past. My past in Syria was terrible but somehow I can remember some really funny parts. Under the Gunfire and artillery strikes, I remember that there was some time where I was laughing.
       I want someone with me to say on my life adventure
