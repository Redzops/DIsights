It been a crazy week, I fought the devil 4 times and lost, I lost track of my prayers, and my Lovebird "Farouz" died. At the same time, I got into the National USU Flight Team and promoted to become a navigator. I love my classes, they are just amazing. I still have this weird dreamy feeling of how I am still USU.
